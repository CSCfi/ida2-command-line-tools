This subdirectory contains behavioral tests for the IDA command line tools. It
depends on there being an installation of the IDA service on the same localhost,
located in /var/ida, and utilizes the IDA configuration and test utility scripts.

RUNNING TESTS:

The tests folder contains a script 'run-tests' which will run all tests.
